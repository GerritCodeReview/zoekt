Were you waiting for me?\n\u003e \n\u003e Sorry, I intended to submit a new Gerrit change containing the newer changes with the alternative approach with treating symbols as docs in an iterator, but it\u0027s probably better to update this one instead. This is definitely not the most performant approach (from the overhead of so many regex match calls) which is why I initially abandoned it. I\u0027ll include benchmarks in the change later this week.\n\nI guess this is not happening anymore?",
