      "message": "haha yeah nix is not the nicest language and the documentation is not great.  But nix is great once you start using it. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth making people use nix, but for those that use nix it is very useful file to have in a repo.\n\nI can document that we have a nix file and link to some documentation. But I\u0027m just as happy leaving this out of the repo if it feels like noise.\n\nThe main motivation I had for adding it was universal-ctags is the only dependency on this repo which doesn\u0027t come easily. This is one way to ensure people have it. But as another sign, I realised it doesn\u0027t have sandbox mode compiled in with nix. I can update this nix expression to compile universal-ctags with sandbox mode. But that is getting into a bit more dark arts. I sent a follow-up change which falls back to not using sandbox mode if it is missing.",
