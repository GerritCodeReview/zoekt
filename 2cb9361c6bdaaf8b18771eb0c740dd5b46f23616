      "message": "I think this is a good move as having multiple matches for a single line and showing them in separately was very confusing for me at first.\n\nIn the future, I would even go one step further and cluster all matches within a file and return their ranges along with some smart snippet selection. This would be a good thing to do before implementing a search-as-you-type system and expose and API.",
